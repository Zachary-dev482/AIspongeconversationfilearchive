It's a… a super video home system?","Patrick: (Eyes widening) Ooooh, SpongeBob! Is it a wishing machine? Can we wish for more Krabby Patties?","(bubble transition)","Squidward: (Grumbling) It's SVHS, you barnacle heads. A prehistoric way to watch TV. Basically, a slightly sharper version of VHS. Ancient technology.","SpongeBob: Sharper? Like, can I see my pores in super detail? Awesome!","Sandy: (Appearing suddenly) Hold on there, SpongeBob! That thing's probably older than dirt. Who knows what's on that tape? Could be dangerous!","(music: seaweed)","Plankton: (Peeking from behind Sandy) Dangerous? Heh heh heh… Perhaps it contains the secret Krabby Patty formula! I MUST HAVE IT!","SpongeBob: (Gasps dramatically) Plankton! You're not going to steal the Krabby Patty formula from an old tape, are you?","Larry: (Flexing his muscles nearby) Whoa now! Slow down, small fry. We don’t want any trouble at the beach!","(a few moments later)","Gary: (Meowing knowingly) Meow.","SpongeBob: You're right, Gary!
