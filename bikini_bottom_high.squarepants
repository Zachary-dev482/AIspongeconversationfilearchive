{"title":"Bikini Bottom High","description":"SpongeBob and his friends navigate the treacherous waters of high school, from jellyfish netting to water polo tryouts, with Plankton even attempting to pass biology!","script":["(music: tomfoolery)","SpongeBob: (Excitedly) First day at Bikini Bottom High, Patrick! I can't wait for advanced jellyfish netting!","Patrick: (Confused) Jellyfish netting? I thought high school was about... napping?","SpongeBob: (Gasps) Napping and jellyfish netting! It's a win-win!","(bubble transition)","Squidward: (Grumbling) Another generation of noisy buffoons. Just what I needed.","Sandy: (Bounding up) Howdy, Squidward! Ready to learn some underwater engineering?","Squidward: Engineering? I'm here for the advanced interpretive dance club. It's my only escape.","Sandy: (Chuckles) Well, maybe we can both learn something new!","(a few moments later)","SpongeBob: (Spotting Plankton) Plankton! What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula?","Plankton: (Scoffs) Please! This is my chance to finally pass biology. Once I understand cellular structure, the Krabby Patty will be mine!","Patrick: (Whispering to SpongeBob) Does that mean... free patties?","SpongeBob: (Shakes head) Focus, Patrick! High school!","(music: street rag)","Larry: (Flexing) Alright everyone, tryouts for the water polo team are today after school, don't be late!","SpongeBob: Water polo? I'm in! I'll use my pores to become a super-absorbent powerhouse!","Patrick: Can I use my belly?","Larry: Sure, just try to not sink the entire team!","(bubble transition)","Squidward: (Practicing interpretive dance, badly) One, two, pli√©! Oh, this is hopeless.","Sandy: (Watching) Maybe if you used a little more...enthusiasm?","Squidward: Enthusiasm? For flailing about in tights? I think not.","(a few moments later)","Gary: (Meow) Meow.","SpongeBob: (To Gary) You came to support me, Gary? Thanks buddy!","Patrick: (Confused) I thought Gary only knew meow.","SpongeBob: He's taking advanced feline studies, Patrick. He's very sophisticated.","(music: gator)","Plankton: (Struggling with a textbook) This is harder than stealing the Krabby Patty formula! Photosynthesis? Mitosis? I need a cheat sheet!","SpongeBob: (Approaching) Need some help, Plankton? I'm pretty good at science!","Plankton: (Suspicious) You? Helping me? What's the catch?","SpongeBob: No catch! Just good old-fashioned high school camaraderie!","(bubble transition)","Patrick: (To Larry) Can I use my belly as a flotation device?","Larry: (Sighs) We'll see, Patrick. We'll see.","(music: nice)","SpongeBob: (To audience) Well, that's highschool! A place of learning, friendship, and confusing science experiments!","Plankton: (Grumbling) Cameradarie? More like 'camara-DIE' once I get my hands on that formula!","(a few moments later)","Sandy: (Enthusiastically) Alright Squidward, let's try this again! Imagine you're a majestic sea serpent, gracefully gliding through the kelp forests!","Squidward: (Deadpan) I'd rather be chum.","(music: molakai)","SpongeBob: (Explaining to Plankton) So, photosynthesis is how plants make their food using sunlight! See, like this kelp!","Plankton: (Eyes the kelp suspiciously) So, if I just...eat enough kelp...I'll understand biology?","SpongeBob: (Laughing) Well, not exactly! But it's a start!","(bubble transition)","Larry: (To the water polo team) Alright team! We're down by one point, there's only 10 seconds left on the clock! We need a miracle!","Patrick: (In the water, floating) I have a miracle! My belly! Use my belly!","Larry: (Exasperated) Just...get the ball to SpongeBob!","(a few moments later)","SpongeBob: (Dribbling the ball with his nose) I got it! I got it! Aiming...Firing!","(music: dramatic sting)","The water polo ball bounces off Patrick's belly, deflecting it into the goal!","Larry: (Ecstatic) We won! We won! Patrick, you're a hero!","Patrick: (Beaming) I knew my belly was good for something!","(bubble transition)","Plankton: (Holding up a microscope slide) I think...I think I finally understand!","SpongeBob: (Excited) You do? That's great, Plankton!","Plankton: (Smiling evilly) Yes! Now I know how to perfectly replicate the Krabby Patty on a cellular level! Prepare yourselves!","Karen (V.O.): Plankton! Dinner's ready!","Plankton: (Sighs) Coming, Karen! (To SpongeBob) This isn't over, SquarePants! (Runs off)","(music: ending theme)","SpongeBob: (To Patrick) Well Patrick, that was high school! What did you learn?","Patrick: (Smiling) My belly is a miracle!","SpongeBob: (Laughing) And highschool is an even bigger one!"],"characters":["Spongebob","Patrick","Gary","Squidward","Sandy","Plankton","Larry"],"timestamp":1739780399259}
