{"title":"Kelp Keg Chaos","description":"SpongeBob and Patrick navigate the treacherous waters of a high school party at Sandy's Treedome, complete with fermented kelp, ID-checking Gary, and a very grumpy Squidward.","script":["(music: tomfoolery)","Spongebob: (Running into the Krusty Krab, panting) Squidward, you won't BELIEVE what happened at boating school today!","Squidward: (Without looking up from his register) I can guarantee you, SpongeBob, that I absolutely do not give a flying fuck.","Spongebob: But Mrs. Puff showed us… (whispers) …advanced parallel parking!","Squidward: Oh, the sheer unadulterated thrill! I'm practically pissing myself with excitement.","(bubble transition)","(a few moments later)","Patrick: (Bursts through the door, equally out of breath) SpongeBob! SpongeBob! Sandy's throwing a party at her treedome tonight! keg stand contest and everything!","Spongebob: A keg stand contest? Involving…beer?","Patrick: (Winks suggestively) Let's just say Sandy's experimenting with fermented kelp. Strong stuff, allegedly.","Squidward: (Eyes widening slightly) Fermented kelp, you say? Is she carding?","Patrick: Nah, she said bring ID, but who the hell knows with her.","(music: street rag)","Spongebob: (Stammering) I…I don’t know, Patrick. That sounds…risky. Mrs. Puff said to never operate heavy machinery after consuming fermented kelp.","Patrick: Relax, SpongeBob. We'll just get plastered and puke our guts out like normal high schoolers! It'll be legendary!","Larry: (Flexing his muscles near the door) Did someone say legendary party? I'm in! Gotta maintain this physique with…hydration.","Sandy: (Walks in, cracking her knuckles) Howdy y'all! Heard y'all talkin' 'bout my little shindig. Gonna be a wild one. I got Gary on the door checking ID, and he don't play.","Gary: (Meows menacingly)","Spongebob: Gary's a bouncer?","Sandy: Damn right he is. He's seen some shit.","Plankton: (Emerging from a chum bucket) Did I hear 'free booze'? Finally, a chance to drown my sorrows in something other than self-pity!","Squidward: (Sighs) This is going to be a disaster.","Spongebob: Plankton, you're too short to reach the tap!","Plankton: (Jumps on a stool) I’ll find a way, you porous bastard! I always do!","(music: gator)","Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob! Live a little! It's high school! Before you know it, we'll be old and wrinkly like Squidward!","Squidward: Hey! I heard that, you pink simpleton!","Spongebob: (Looks from Patrick to Squidward, then to Sandy) Alright, alright, I'm in. But if I get expelled, I'm blaming all of you.","Sandy: That's the spirit! Let's get this party started, before Gary starts biting ankles!","(music: wahini wobble)"],"characters":["Spongebob","Patrick","Gary","Squidward","Sandy","Plankton","Larry"],"timestamp":1739780677685}
