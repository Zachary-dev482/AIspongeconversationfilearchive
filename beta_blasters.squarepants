    "Narrator: Ah, Bikini Bottom. A place where the sun shines, the kelp sways, and strange things are always washing ashore. Today is no exception.",
    "(scene: Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob and Patrick are catching jellyfish)",
    "SpongeBob: Golly, Patrick, this is the best jellyfish-catching day ever!",
    "Patrick: You said it, SpongeBob! I've already stung myself... like, five times!",
    "SpongeBob: That's the spirit! Keep your eye on the prize!",
    "(Patrick wanders off and trips over something half-buried in the sand.)",
    "Patrick: Oof! What in Neptune's name...?",
    "SpongeBob: Patrick, are you okay? Did you find another rock to befriend?",
    "Patrick: Better! Look at this rectangular... thing!",
    "(SpongeBob rushes over. It's a partially buried BetaMax player.)",
    "SpongeBob: Wowee! What is it?",
    "Patrick: Beats me. But it looks important!",
    "SpongeBob: Maybe it's a newfangled kind of cooler!",
    "(music: tomfoolery)",
    "Patrick: Let's take it back to your place and dissect it!",
    "SpongeBob: Great idea, Patrick! Let's get it home!",
    "(bubble transition)",
    "(scene: SpongeBob's house. They've cleaned off the BetaMax player)",
    "SpongeBob: Well, it's definitely not a cooler. It has buttons and a slot!",
    "Patrick: Maybe it's a fancy toaster!",
    "SpongeBob: (examines the back) Hmm, 'BetaMax Player'... never heard of it.",
    "Patrick: Maybe it's broken.",
    "SpongeBob: Let's not give up yet! We need to find out how this thing works!",
    "(SpongeBob rummages through a box of random objects)",
    "SpongeBob: Aha! I got this from the Bargain Mart last week! An instruction manual for everything ever invented!",
    "(SpongeBob flips through the enormous book)",
    "SpongeBob: Nope, no BetaMax Player...",
    "(A knock at the door)",
    "SpongeBob: I'll get it!",
    "(SpongeBob opens the door. It's a shady-looking fish wearing a trench coat.)",
    "Shady Fish: Psst, you wouldn't happen to be interested in some... 'vintage media,' would you?",
    "SpongeBob: Vintage media? Like... old newspapers?",
    "Shady Fish: (opens his trench coat to reveal a collection of BetaMax tapes) I'm talking BetaMax tapes, kid! Rare finds!",
    "Patrick: Woah!",
    "SpongeBob: What's the damage?",
    "Shady Fish: For the whole collection... and these are primo tapes... $150.",
    "SpongeBob: $150?! I don't have that kind of money!",
    "Patrick: I think I have some money... (Checks his pockets) Nope. Just lint and a half-eaten Krabby Patty.",
    "Shady Fish: Too bad. These tapes are a goldmine. You'll never find them anywhere else.",
    "(The Shady Fish starts to leave.)",
    "SpongeBob: Wait! I know someone who might be interested!",
    "(bubble transition)",
    "(scene: Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is counting money.)",
    "SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! We need your help!",
    "Mr. Krabs: Help? I only help when it involves makin' money! What's this about?",
    "SpongeBob: There's a guy selling BetaMax tapes for $150, and they're super rare!",
    "Mr. Krabs: Beta-what now? What's a BetaMax tape?",
    "SpongeBob: We don't know! But they must be valuable if this guy is selling them for so much!",
    "Mr. Krabs: (eyes widen) Valuable, you say? Show me these 'tapes!'",
    "(bubble transition)",
    "(scene: SpongeBob's house. Mr. Krabs is examining the tapes.)",
    "Mr. Krabs: Hmm, these look old, alright. I haven't seen one of these since I was a lad!",
    "Mr. Krabs: Alright, I'll buy 'em! But you two are workin' off the debt!",
    "SpongeBob: Hooray!",
    "(music: rakehornpipe)",
    "(Mr. Krabs hands the Shady Fish the money and takes the tapes.)",
    "Shady Fish: Pleasure doing business with you!",
    "(The Shady Fish disappears.)",
    "Mr. Krabs: Alright, let's see what treasures we've acquired!",
    "(Mr. Krabs tries to insert a tape into the BetaMax player)",
    "Mr. Krabs: Now, how does this contraption work?",
    "SpongeBob: I don't know, but I'm eager to find out!",
    "(They fiddle with the BetaMax player for a while, without success.)",
    "Patrick: Maybe Sandy knows! She's smart!",
    "SpongeBob: Great idea, Patrick!",
    "(bubble transition)",
    "(scene: Sandy's treedome)",
    "SpongeBob: Sandy! We need your help!",
    "Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob! What's all the commotion?",
    "SpongeBob: We found this weird machine, and we don't know how it works!",
    "(SpongeBob and Patrick show Sandy the BetaMax player and tapes.)",
    "Sandy: Well, I'll be! That's a BetaMax player! They were all the rage back in the day... before VHS came along.",
    "Mr. Krabs: VHS? What's the difference?",
    "Sandy: It's a long story, but trust me, VHS won. BetaMax was kinda a flop.",
    "Mr. Krabs: A flop?! I spent $150 on a flop?!",
    "(music: dreadnought)",
    "Sandy: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs! These tapes might still be interesting. Let's see what's on 'em.",
    "(Sandy expertly loads a tape into the BetaMax player.)",
    "(The screen flickers to life. It's a black and white training video about how to properly mop a floor.)",
    "SpongeBob: Wow, educational!",
    "Patrick: Booooring!",
    "Mr. Krabs: This is what I wasted my money on?!",
    "(They watch several tapes. They're all dull instructional videos or old commercials.)",
    "Squidward: (entering Sandy's treedome) What's all the racket? Can't a cephalopod get some peace and quiet around here?",
    "SpongeBob: We're watching BetaMax tapes!",
    "Squidward: BetaMax? Ugh, even in the 80s those were outdated.",
    "Patrick: Check out this tape! It has a label 'Do Not Watch!'",
    "SpongeBob: Ooh! That sounds exciting!",
    "Mr. Krabs: Maybe this is the one that'll make my investment worthwhile!",
    "(Sandy reluctantly puts the 'Do Not Watch!' tape in. The screen fills with static, then clears to show a bizarre, experimental art film featuring abstract shapes and strange noises.)",
    "(music: street rag)",
    "SpongeBob: Whoa! What is this?",
    "Patrick: My brain is melting!",
    "Squidward: (eyes wide) This is... actually quite avant-garde!",
    "Mr. Krabs: I don't understand any of this!",
    "(The film continues, becoming increasingly strange and nonsensical.)",
    "Sandy: Okay, that's enough! I'm turning it off!",
    "(Sandy ejects the tape.)",
    "SpongeBob: That was... something else!",
    "Patrick: I think I need a Krabby Patty to recover!",
    "Mr. Krabs: Well, that was a complete waste of time and money!",
    "Squidward: Actually, Krabs, that film was quite fascinating. A true expression of existential dread through the medium of obsolete technology.",
    "Mr. Krabs: You think so?",
    "Squidward: Absolutely! It's a masterpiece!",
    "Mr. Krabs: (eyes widen again) A masterpiece?! Maybe I can sell tickets to see this thing!",
    "(bubble transition)",
    "(scene: The Krusty Krab. A long line of fish are waiting outside.)",
    "Mr. Krabs: Alright, folks! Step right up and witness the greatest cinematic achievement ever committed to BetaMax! Only five dollars!",
    "SpongeBob: (to Patrick) I can't believe people are actually paying to see that!",
    "Patrick: Me neither! Want to go catch more jellyfish?",
    "SpongeBob: You bet! I feel like I've seen enough weird stuff for one day.",
    "(SpongeBob and Patrick leave the Krusty Krab)",
    "Squidward: (to himself) Finally, some culture in this backwater town!",
    "(music: ending theme)",
    "Narrator: And so, another strange day in Bikini Bottom comes to an end. Who knew an old BetaMax player could bring so much chaos... and maybe even a little bit of art appreciation?",
    "(fade to black)"
