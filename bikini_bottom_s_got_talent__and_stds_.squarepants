{"title":"Bikini Bottom's Got Talent (and STDs)","description":"The residents of Bikini Bottom get a little too real as Patrick's libido runs wild, Sandy threatens bodily harm, and Plankton attempts another ridiculously violent scheme to steal the Krabby Patty formula.","script":["Spongebob: (music: tomfoolery) Holy fish paste, Patrick! Did you see Larry's biceps at the gym today? They're thicker than my goddamn head!","Patrick: (a few moments later) Biceps, schmiceps, Spongebob. I'm more interested in Sandy's...assets. You know, that Texas tail.","Spongebob: Patrick! You can't just say that! She'll hear you, you moron!","Patrick: Relax, buddy. She's probably too busy inventing some kind of squirrel dildo or something.","Sandy: (suddenly behind them, furious) What in tarnation did you just say, you starfish son of a bitch?!","Patrick: (nervously) Uh... nothing, Sandy! Just admiring your... uh... scientific prowess!","Sandy: You better be! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to Krusty Krab. Heard Plankton's trying to steal the formula again.","(bubble transition)","Squidward: (at the Krusty Krab, annoyed) Oh, joy. Plankton's here again. Can't a cephalopod get a goddamn break around here?","Plankton: (cackling) This time, Krabs, I'll get that formula, even if I have to shove dynamite up your greedy ass!","Mr. Krabs: (music: street rag) Not if I have anything to say about it, ya microscopic bastard! Larry, get over here and flex your way into stopping him! And SpongeBob, get me my spatula!
